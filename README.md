# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The repository hosts the code written in R and the documentation files for the Project: Getting and Cleaning Data from the course Data Science from John Hopkins University.

The dataset object of this study is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" provided by the Course organizers. 

To use the code, it is necessary to have the data in the same folder, using the same names and not compressed. 

The CodeBook.md file have the description of the data, variables, and the work performed to organize and clean up the data. 

The code is stored in the file run_analysis.R that performs the analyses described in the 5 required steps to complete this project.

The output of the project is uploaded in the Project page.
